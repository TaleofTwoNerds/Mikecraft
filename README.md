Mikecraft
=========

I desgined mikecraft as a solo project, which is part of why all of the textures are from Minecraft. I designed all of the game mechanics and wrote all of the code. If there are any errors please send me an email-I would like to fix them. I work hard every day on this so any comments would be very much appreciated. With each update I add more to the code and slim down some of my older rustier code. I try to keep all of the classes updated and make sure everything stays 100% up to date.
