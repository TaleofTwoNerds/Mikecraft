Mikecraft
=========

<<<<<<< HEAD
All textures are copyright Mojang AB except for the character (robot) skins and the flag.
Included in the Mikecraft source code is the image files for all of the textures in-game.
NOTE: I have removed the textures which came directly from Minecraft. You will need to find them yourself or make your own textures.

All other code is mine own work and is copyright Blaine Harper. Free to use for education or research, but not for commercial use.
=======
I desgined mikecraft as a solo project, which is part of why all of the textures are from Minecraft. I designed all of the game mechanics and wrote all of the code. If there are any errors please send me an email-I would like to fix them. I work hard every day on this so any comments would be very much appreciated. With each update I add more to the code and slim down some of my older rustier code. I try to keep all of the classes updated and make sure everything stays 100% up to date.
